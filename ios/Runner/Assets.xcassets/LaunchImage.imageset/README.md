# Launch Screen Assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desiprimaries[8] assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

You can also do it by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desiprimaries[8] images.
